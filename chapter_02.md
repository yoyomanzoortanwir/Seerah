### The Arabs and the selection of Arabia

In the previous chapter, we discussed the _jahiliyya_, the loss of the original _Ahl-al-Kitab_, and political strife in the lands surrounding and in Arabia. While the Arabs were the most ignorant of people, in some regard they were also the most simple. While the Romans, the Persians, and the Indians had strong senses of nationalism and cultural identity, the Arabs were nomadic and loyal to a smaller circle of influence (that is, their tribe). They were so loyal that they would readily pick up arms in retaliation to beliefs they did not agree with, for the sake of the beliefs and values they did agree with. They did not carry the baggage of centuries of conquering and being conquered or generations of great national wealth, but lived alone in their own ignorance, and were thus relatively impressionable and amenable (compared to other nations, there was a much purer interaction with novel ideas, of ‘my beliefs vs his’ as opposed to ‘the beliefs of our nation vs his’).

Other nations had other problems that would preclude them from accepting _wahi_. The Byzantines and Sassanids were complete hedonists, with the Byzantines reducing the intellectual curiosity of the Greeks to the mere attainment of pleasure — even the Greek gods were turned from a genuine attempt to understand the universe to perverted stories of pure fiction. The Sassanids lacked a uniform moral code and lived often barbarically. None of these nations would have hung their desires for the sake of true principles.

Another issue with other nations is a rigorous social and class structure. Almost every nation at the time, from imperialism in China to the class system in India, had deeply embedded hierarchy in society. The nomadic and unconquered history of Arabia meant social structures began in the tribe, not from a ruling class. Furthermore, the central location of Arabia (compared to other unconquered, nomadic nations such as Japan and northern Russia) meant Islam had the potential to influence the strongest nations at the time, the Byzantines and the Sassanids.

Furthermore, Mecca is in Arabia, and the Ka’bah is in Mecca. The spiritual importance of the House of Allah ﷻ, built by Ibrahim (AS) and Ismail (AS) centuries before, meant that there was a priming for the Arabs for the incoming revelation. In fact, the Jews in Arabia were aware that a prophet would be sent in that land, and lived nearby in anticipation. This was a land chosen by Allah ﷻ for this purpose, and a fulfillment of promises in the books revealed before and du'as of previous prophets.

In summary, the social, political, geographical, and historical contexts for Arabic were all important in its relevance as the place of revelation through Rasulullah ﷺ. There are many other reasons as well, of course, such as the importance of the Arabic language and the love of poetry amongst the Arabs, and the culture and religion of the Arabs, and all these reasons play a role in how Islam came to spread peace through the surrounding regions and the world at large.
