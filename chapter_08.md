# Difference between Makkan and Madinan societies

### The Jews of Madinah

The Jews had been in Yathrib since the first century CE. In 70 CE, when Jerusalem was crusaded by the Romans and the Jews were evicted, a group migrated to Arabia and settled in Madinah. They formed 3 tribes:

- Qaynuqa (~700 fighters)
- An-Nadir (~700 fighters)
- Qurayzah (between 700 and 900 fighters)

These tribes were opposed to each other, however, as mentioned in the Quran:

At the time of Rasulullah ﷺ, Banu an-Nadir and Qurayzah hated Banu Qaynuqa because they sided with Banu Khazraj in the battle of Bu'ath in 617 AD. Thus, while the Jews lived separate from the rest of the Arabs in Yathrib, Banu an-Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa forced Banu Qaynuqa to the outskirts of Madinah.

#### Religious affairs of the Jews

The Jews passed down knowledge in seminaries called _midra_, where they taught religious and secular sciences. They prayed in synagogues. They followed the Pentateuch, but also followed the customs their rabbis would include in their religion. While they continued their tradition of religion in some form, they were not truly practicing, as besides the fundamental tenets of their relegion they were otherwise indistinguishable from their polytheist neighbors. For example, they spent their time in magic and soothsaying.  
Their most egregious shortcoming, however, was ignoring the message sent to them by Rasullulah ﷺ, in spite of the evident proof that he was the very man they were waiting for to be their prophet. They would even mock him, calling him رعنا since they were not listening to him.

#### Finances

The Jews were often creditors, lending money or property. When recompense was needed, they would ask for women and men. These practices only further increased tensions between the Jews and the Arabs. The Jews were able to lend out capital because they owned the capital through usury, hoarding, and profiteering. Perhaps they felt a sense of entitlement, as the 'ones who receive divine guidance,' yet they were the most misguided.
