# Difference between Makkan and Madinan societies

### The Jews of Madinah

The Jews had been in Yathrib since the first century CE. In 70 CE, when Jerusalem was crusaded by the Romans and the Jews were evicted, a group migrated to Arabia and settled in Madinah. They formed 3 tribes:

- Qaynuqa (~700 fighters)
- An-Nadir (~700 fighters)
- Qurayzah (between 700 and 900 fighters)

These tribes were opposed to each other, however, as mentioned in the Quran:

At the time of Rasulullah ﷺ, Banu an-Nadir and Qurayzah hated Banu Qaynuqa because they sided with Banu Khazraj in the battle of Bu'ath in 617 AD. Thus, while the Jews lived separate from the rest of the Arabs in Yathrib, Banu an-Nadir and Banu Qurayzah forced Banu Qaynuqa to the outskirts of Madinah.

#### Religious affairs of the Jews

The Jews passed down knowledge in seminaries called _midra_, where they taught religious and secular sciences. They prayed in synagogues. They followed the Pentateuch, but also followed the customs their rabbis would include in their religion. While they continued their tradition of religion in some form, they were not truly practicing, as besides the fundamental tenets of their relegion they were otherwise indistinguishable from their polytheist neighbors. For example, they spent their time in magic and soothsaying.  
Their most egregious shortcoming, however, was ignoring the message sent to them by Rasullulah ﷺ, in spite of the evident proof that he was the very man they were waiting for to be their prophet. They would even mock him, calling him رعنا since they were ignoring him.

#### Finances

The Jews were often creditors, lending money or property. When recompense was needed, they would ask for women and men. These practices only further increased tensions between the Jews and the Arabs. The Jews were able to lend out capital because they owned the capital through usury, hoarding, and profiteering. Perhaps they felt a sense of entitlement, as the 'ones who receive divine guidance,' yet they were the most misguided.

#### Religious and cultural conditions

In the beginning of this chapter, there is a quote from Dr. Israel Wellphenson that highlights how the Jews kept their religion to themselves and would not invite others to their religion. Perhaps an interesting aspect to this is again the pride of the Jews and the religious superiority they claimed to have over others. This is also reflected in their language and culture. For the former, they spoke a mix of Arabic and Hebrew, maintaining Hebrew for transmission of knowledge. Socially, they were constantly fighting against the Khazraj and Aws tribes and maintained exclusivity. However, their 6 centuries of neighboring Banu Khazraj and Aws meant that these tribes were acutely aware of Judaism, and some even became Jew through marriage or through a custom of leaving a child with the Jews if one dies in infancy. 

### The Aws and the Khazraj

| <b>Marib dam in Yemen</b>|

These tribes are originally from Yemen. In about 145 BC, the dam of Marib was severely breached by the people of Saba, as mentioned in the Quran:

![saba15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90349598/135143578-930e5837-95c2-481b-8740-2a0342ae3f16.PNG)

![Saba17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90349598/135143628-121da12d-2d44-4d29-a891-f303558dd3eb.PNG)

There was also political unrest in Yemen. The Aws and Khazraj descend from the tribe of Azd, who migrated in waves to Madinah and other nothern areas (there were multiple times of unrest and the dam being broken in Yemen over the centuries, from 145 BCE until at least 6th century CE, until the advent of Islam and eventual conquer of Yemen).

The Aws settled in the southeast of Madinah, while the Khazraj were north and central. The Aws were closer to fertile ground, as south of Madinah held forests and date trees, while Khazraj were in less fertile land.

Banu Khazraj consisted of four clans:

- Malik
- Adi
- Mazin
- Dinar

Both the Aws and Khazraj had sizeable power, but it is uncertain exactly how many were in. At the time of the proohet ﷺ, the Arabs had the upper hand after a series of battles between the resident tribes in Madinah, the most recent of which was only 5 years before Hijrah. 

The enmity between the Aws, Khazraj, and the Jews is seen in the incident with Sha'th ibn Qays, one of the Jews. He passed by some Aws and Khazraj together in harmony, and in spite recited poems of the past to inflame them. The Aws and Khazraj indeed became inflamed and began bickering until Rasulullah ﷺ came and settled their hearts. Such were the passions they had in the past.

### Physical and geographical conditions

As seen in the earlier image, at the time of Rasulullah ﷺ there was clear separation between tribes spatially. Each contained lands for growing and livestock, lands for living, and land for protection (fortresses), since such was the type of society they were in. The Jews in particular had 95 such fortresses. What a strange society, each tribe at each others throats, living in proximity for centuries, built in such a way that they relied on each other for survival as much as they needed to protect themselves from one another. In the Quran, this is referenced:

Physically, Madinah has several plains formed through lava. Notably, on the east is Harrat al Waqim and on the west is Harrat al-Wabarah. These plains of igneous, dangerous rocks prevent attack from the sides of Madinah. Coupled with the foresty land on the south, and Madinah was practically a physical stronghold.
