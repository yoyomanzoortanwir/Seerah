At the tender age of 6, Rasulullah ﷺ's mother Aminah passed away. Two years later, Abdul Muttalib, his grandfather, passed away. Thus, at the age of 8, he was under the care of his uncle Abu Talib. When he was 9 years old, he went with Abu Talib on a caravan trip to Busra in Syria. In Syria, Abu Talib and Rasulullah ﷺ met a monk by the name of Bahira. Bahira welcomed their caravan. When he saw Rasulullah ﷺ, he told Abu Talib to take him ﷺ back and hide him from the Jews, and advised that he will become a man of great stature. Abu Talib heeded this advice.  
This incident has been used by some arguments that claim the Islam is merely a made religion based on Christianity. The argument goes that in this meeting with Basira, Basira taught monotheism and instigated the foundation of Islam. Some arguments go even further and claim that all of the Quran was relayed in this moment. These notions are impossible for several reasons:

- The narrations regarding this meeting contain weakness — it is uncertain if it truly happened, as one of the narrators is unreliable.
- As far as is known, Rasulullah ﷺ did not understand aramaic, and would not understand what Bahira was saying.
- Rasulullah ﷺ was extremely young, and it is unlikely he would be able to understand the intricacies to Christian beliefs which were not even fully understood by its contemporaries.
- The monk could not have known about the events to come in the future that the Qur'an speaks about, such as the ayat in surah Rum regarding the defeat of the Romans (and the prophecy of their upcoming success). This, and many other ayat that comment or predict in the future could not be possible for the monk to know and relay to Rasulullah ﷺ in the short time they were together.

As Rasulullah ﷺ got older, he became a beacon of righteousness and torchbearer of trustworthiness amongst the _jahil_ Arabs in Makkah. He lived simply and with austerity, with kindness and compassion. He became known as _Al-Amin_, the Trustworthy. He earned his own living as a shepherd. Unlike other forms of handiwork or manual labor, shepherding was not viewed scornfully by the Arabs. They at least understood the patience and integrity of a shepherd, and the dignity it commands.

When Rasulullah ﷺ was 25, he married Khadijahؓ, a wealthy merchant and businesswoman. She was a woman of integrity and honor. Together, they had 6 children.

His gifted poise and sound mind as well as the positive impression he had on his people in his youth are manifest in how he solved the conundrum of placing _Hajr al-Aswad_ into the Ka'bah during its reconstruction. This was a matter that caused so much strife amongst the Arabs that Banu Abd ad-Dar and Banu Adi bloodied their hands in anticipation of battle. This is because to the Arabs little or nothing mattered more than honor, and the honor of placing the black stone was worth breaking ties and killing one another for them. Rasulullah ﷺ solved the situation by using a cloth, which each tribe grabbed a part of. They lifted the stone to its place, being set in position with the hands of Rasulullah ﷺ. From this event, we see how Rasulullah ﷺ's remarkable kindness and cool-headedness could resolve times where people were literally in arms against each other.
