# Chapter 7

#### The beginning of Islam amongst the Ansar

Rasulullah ﷺ met with the people of Khazraj from Yathrib at 'Aqabah. When he shared some ayaat of the Quran with them, they exclaimed that this was the messenger prophesized to them by the Jews of Yathrib. They accepted Islam and returned to their homes to spread the message.

#### First pledge of 'Aqabah

The next year, 12 men from the Ansar met Rasulullah ﷺ at 'Aqabah. They took a pledge:

- not to steal
- not to fornicate
- not to kill their children
- to obey Rasulullah ﷺ in Haqq
- to associate nothing with Allah ﷻ

Mus'ab ibn Umayrؓ was sent back with them to teach the Qur'an and spread Islam.

#### The reason for the Ansar's acceptance of Islam

The acceptance of Islam by the Aws and Khazraj in Yathrib was a huge milestone — the tribes of Makkah and Taif had rejected the message Rasulullah ﷺ brought, and the Aws and Khazraj became the first tribes to accept.

1. The people of Aws and Khazraj were more soft-hearted than their counterparts elsewhere in Arabia

Unlike the people of Makkah, their tribes were free from the intolerant, aggressive, and ignorant perspectives of the Quraysh and those in Makkah. Rasulullah ﷺ himself has said, "The people of Yemen have come to you. They have the most tender manners and gentlest hearts." In the Quran, Allah ﷻ says:

2. Continuous war led to exhaustion and acceptance

Aws and Khazraj had been battling against each other and against the Jews for a long time. They were tired of war and desired peace. Just 5 years before Hijra, they had fought a battle of Bu'ath, and were exhausted and weary.

3. They were neighbors to the Jews.

The Quraysh were far from revelation. They were deep into shirk and avoided the messages from Christians and Jews. The Aws and Khazraj, however, were near Jews who maintained some level of connection with their heritage. The Jews were in Madinah awaiting to find their prophesized prophet. Thus, these tribes were not foreign to the idea of revelation and scripture.

#### Strategic importance of Madinah

The western side of Madinah is walled off by mountains, while the east and south had foresty plantations. The only exposed side of Madinah was the north.

The Aws and Khazraj that resided in Yathrib were fierce, bold, and free. They lived alone and unmanaged for generations, and their skill in riding animals symbolized their free spritedness. They also had some blood ties to the Quraysh and Rasulullah ﷺ, as Abd' al-Muttalib's mother was from Banu'Adi ibn an-Najjar, a tribe in Yathrib.  
The Aws and Khazrah had, however, historically been opposed to the Quraysh since they traced their geneology to Qahtan, while the Quraysh are from Adnan. Thus, the acceptance of both these tribes as _Ansar_ and the Makkans as _Muhajireen_ meant the resolution of many years of quarrel.

In summary, Madinah as the place of emigration was an important military and cultural advancement.

#### Expansion of Islam in Madinah

Islam spread like wildfire in Madinah through Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr. Of those that converted,

- Sa'd ibn Mu'adh
- Usayd ibn Hudayr, the leader of Banu Abd al-Ashhal, a clan in Aws

Through Usayd, Banu Abd al-Ashhal accepted Islam.

#### Second pledge of 'Aqabah

The next year at the time of pilgrimage, 73 Ansar (including 2 women) came to visit Rasulullah ﷺ again at 'Aqabah. Rasulullah ﷺ was accompanied by his uncle, 'Abbas. Again, the people of Madinah took allegiance with Rasulullah ﷺ, but they requested that he leaves Makkah and comes to them.

#### Permission to migrate to Madinah

Rasulullah ﷺ tells the people of Makkah to migrate to Madinah, but he himself remains in Makkah as he was not yet given permission to migrate. The Quraysh, of course, were not happy with this. They tried to stop the Muslims from leaving, since not only did these kuffar reject Islam they were so blinded by their ignorance they wished to stop others from hearing it lest they accept it. Perhaps it was out of arrogance, since they knew it was the Truth yet they refused to accept it.

Of the Muslims that migrated, many had to leave behind family, such as Abu Salamah, and wealth, such as Suhayb. Those who left were:

- Umar
- Talhah
- Hamzah
- Zayd ibn Harithah
- Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf
- az-Zubayr ibn Awwam
- Abu Hudhayfah
- Uthman ibn Affan
- several other

Those who remained included Rasulullah ﷺ and Abu Bakr and Ali, and those who were restrained or held by the Makkan Kuffar.
