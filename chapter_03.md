While previous chapters were focused on the results of the people of the book and _jahiliyyah_ in the major nations of the time and Arabia, this chapter is focused on the cultural, geographical, and ethnic makeup of Arabia.

Arabia forms 5 main locations through geographical divisions: Hijaz lies in the west, from the mountains of Najd on the east and the Red Sea on the west and yemen bordering the south. Tihama lines the Red Sea in Hijaz. Yemen occupiees the southwest corner. Najd was a vast expanse of desert from the mountains on the west to Bahrain in the east. And finally Arud also lies between Hijaz and Bahrain.

The geographical setting, of vast desert, meant that the Arabs lived nomadically, relying on natural water sources whereever they could find it and digging deep wells to continue to live and let their livestock graze. This lifestyle meant the Arabs were hardy and tribal people. They were extremely loyal to their group, since they relied on each other for survival. They were hospitable to their allies and staunch against their enemies. After all, in life and death you trust those you trust deeply and fear and hate those you don't like or hold a grudge against deeply.

In spite of their disparate living conditions, the Arabs had some cultural events. Since many were traders and caravaners, festivals offered a major economic opportunity for the Arabs. These festivals generated the unique characteristics of each city, from Yathrib to Makkah to Yemen, as they reflected the bedouins that would come to those specific geographic locations for their trade.

The Arabs had received revelation for many generations, from prohpets such as Hud, Salih, Shu'ayb, and of course Ibrahim and Ismail (AS). Thus, in Arabia there were three major ethnic populations: 'Arab Ba'idah, who were the Arabs of the past that no longer existed, the 'Arab 'Aribah, the Arabised Arabs that were descended from the Ba'idah, and the 'Arab Musta'ribah, who were descended from Ismail (AS) and settled in Hijaz. They are, in a sense, 'naturalized.' In spite of many generations of prophetic guidance, the state of the Arabs before the advent of Rasulullah ï·º further highlights the dismal process of discent they faced.

Surprisingly, in spite of vast geographic separation between peoples, they managed to maintain a similar language, with minor differences between people. Those who were close to the Byzantines and the Persians and Indians had some level of mixing of languages, but for the most part Arabic was ubiquitous. It was so important to their culture that they wrote poems and ballads, and would compete in poetry. In many respects the Arabs lived a barbaric life, surviving by the skin of their teeth, yet they maintained an elegant and beautiful literary tradition.
