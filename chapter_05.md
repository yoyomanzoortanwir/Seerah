# Makkah, the prophet's birth place ï·º

The Arabs respected the Ka'bah so much they didn't make rectangular houses or houses taller than the Ka'bah.

Makkah was sparsely populated, but Qusayy bin Kibab set up working infrastructure and basic civil engineering to create a village in Makkah. He and his family, as Quraysh, led Makkah and formed the house of Assembly, where the major Makkan tribes and allies of the Quraysh would meet. All major responsibities and honors were held by Qusayy, and once he passed away these responsibilities and honors were divided among families. The duties were akin to the responsibilities of office in government. Thus, Makkah became a bustling city with a rudimentary government.

| **Caravans would head north in summer and south in winter** |

Makkah became a major commercial center for Arabs. Twice a year, Quraysh would send caravans, one North to Syria during summer and one south to Yemen during winter.  
In the city proper, the markets were divided by type of market. Fruits and groceries were in one section, perfume in another, cloth and shoes in another, etc. There was also an entertainment district, as well-to-do young men would spend time in Makkah for leisure in winter.  
The focus of business was trade. They regularly traded with Asia and Africa. Women were also business owners and traders and merchants.  
The Makkans were also smart about their business. They targeted specific markets throughout the year and set their market in their favor.
